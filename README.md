* 2018 - Circle Inversion: Circle inversion can be used to solve difficult problems such as proving Pappus’ theorem by visually showing similarity between circles and their inverted images. However, it may not be trivial to see the inversion without proper drawings and calculations. Since it wasn’t practical to draw circles with various sizes and calculate their inversions on paper, I decided to develop a computer program with graphics features to draw basic shapes such as points, lines, and circles. This program let me simulate circle inversion and Pappus chain visually, while also showing the calculations. I decided to develop a web page in HTML and JavaScript with client-side coding. It runs in the latest browsers on all computers and mobile devices. I share this software application as an open-source tool with anyone interested: http://sukarablog.weebly.com
