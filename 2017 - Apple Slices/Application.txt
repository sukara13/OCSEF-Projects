How To Keep Your Apple Slices Healthy

1300 Microbiology and Cell Biology

Investigate the microorganisms on an apple slice by taking a clean cotton swab, rubbing it along the cut surfaces of the apple slice, and then gently swiping the swab across the surface of an agar plate. Seal the plates and leave them someplace warm for one to two days, until you see colonies of bacteria or fungus.

Nutrient agar plates (10), available from online supplies such as Carolina Biological Supply Company, catalog # 821862

Nutrient agar plates will come in a media kit ready to use for my experiment. I will use nitrile exam gloves while working with the agar plates. I will place each petri dish inside a zip lock bag to prevent drying out and to control odors. I will turn the plates upside down, put them in a box, and keep them in a warm place like the garage.

I will treat used agar plates as biohazardous waste, and put them into a red biohazard bag. I will seal the bag with tape to keep the materials enclosed and prevent leaks.

Petri dishes will be sealed with two tapes immediately after swiping the cotton swabs, and will be taken to the science lab at school in 20 minutes.

Project Abstract Format For Science Projects
Problem Statement: What is the question to be answered through your experiment?
Su: How can I keep apple slices healthy for a week?

Hypothesis: What is your testable explanation or proposed hypothetical relationship between your variables.
Su: Apple slices will stay healthy if I dip them in salty water and keep them in a sealed bag in refrigerator.

Materials: List major equipment, all chemicals and materials used.
Su: Apples, knife, cutting board, bowls, plates, salt, lemons, ginger ale, nitrile exam gloves, tape, nutrient agar plates, cotton swabs

Procedure:
A. What major steps did you follow to investigate the problem?
B. What factor (variable) did you alter in order to test your hypothesis?
C. Describe your sample size and number of trials.
D. What measurements did you take?
Su:
1) Prepare 3 bowls:
   Bowl 1: Add 3 cups of water, one table spoon salt, and mix them.
   Bowl 2: Add 3 cups of water, squeeze one lemon, and mix them.
   Bowl 3: Add 3 cups of ginger ale.
2) Peel 6 apples, and slice each of them into 4 pieces to have 24 slices.
3) Build 8 groups of 3 apple slices from 24 slices:
   Group 1: No dipping and leave open on a plate (control group)
   Group 2: No dipping and place in a sealed bag
   Group 3: Dip in salty water for 15 minutes and leave open on a plate
   Group 4: Dip in salty water for 15 minutes and place in a sealed bag
   Group 5: Dip in lemon juice for 15 minutes and leave open on a plate
   Group 6: Dip in lemon juice for 15 minutes and place in a sealed bag
   Group 7: Dip in ginger ale for 15 minutes and leave open on a plate
   Group 8: Dip in ginger ale for 15 minutes and place in a sealed bag
4) Place the plates at the same level in the refrigerator, and leave for 7 days
5) Label 8 agar plates, one for each group.
6) Rub a cotton swab on the apple slices, and swipe the swab across the surface of an agar plate.
7) Seal the plates and take them to the science lab at school where they will be left in a warm place for 2 days.
8) Open the plates, and observe the colonies of bacteria and fungus under a microscope.

Results of Experiment: Describe briefly the measurements you obtained from your experiments as well as the results of any mathematical calculations.
Su: Bacteria growth in each group (lowest to highest shown from 1 to 8):
   Group 1: 8
   Group 2: 4
   Group 3: 5
   Group 4: 1
   Group 5: 6
   Group 6: 2
   Group 7: 7
   Group 8: 3

Conclusion: Briefly describe the answer to your initial question based on the results you obtained in your experiments.
Su: My hypothesis proved to be correct since the apple slices dipped in salty water and kept in a sealed bag developed the least amount of bacteria.

Project Abstract Format For Engineering Projects
Problem Statement: What is the problem to be solved by your project?
